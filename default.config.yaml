  # Game Overview

  Bubble Merge is a fast-paced categorization game where players race to identify and merge correct bubbles into a target category.

  ## Setup

  ### 1. Choose Your Mode

  **Manual Entry:**
  - Enter a target category (e.g., "Breaking Bad Characters")
  - Add correct bubbles (items that belong to the category)
  - Add incorrect bubbles (distractors that don't belong)
  - Set the number of rounds (1-10)

  **AI Generated:**
  - Enter a theme or topic (e.g., "Breaking Bad", "Planets", "React Hooks")
  - Set the number of rounds
  - AI will generate unique puzzles for each round with increasing difficulty

  ### 2. Share the Game

  - Share the **Player Link** or QR code with participants
  - Open the **Presenter Link** on a TV/projector for spectators
  - Players join on their mobile devices

  ### 3. Start the Game

  Once you've created a puzzle and players have joined, click **Start Round** to begin!

  ## Gameplay

  ### For Players:

  1. **Objective:** Drag and drop the correct bubbles to the center target bubble
  2. **Scoring:**
     - ✅ Correct bubble = +100 points
     - ❌ Wrong bubble = -50 points penalty
  3. **Time Limit:** Each round has a 30-second timer
  4. **Competition:** First to absorb all correct bubbles wins the round!

  ### For Host:

  - Monitor player progress in real-time
  - View connections and player names
  - Click **New Game** to reset and start over

  ## Round Progression

  - After each round, there's a 3-second countdown
  - The next round starts automatically
  - In AI mode, each round has a new puzzle
  - In manual mode, the same puzzle is shuffled
  - Final results are shown after all rounds complete

  ## Scoring System

  - **Completion Time:** Faster completion = higher rank
  - **Accuracy:** Fewer mistakes = better score
  - **Absorbed Count:** Number of correct bubbles collected
  - **Score:** Calculated from correct answers minus penalties

  ## Tips for Hosts

  1. **Test First:** Try the game yourself before hosting with a group
  2. **Clear Categories:** Choose categories with obvious correct/incorrect items
  3. **Appropriate Difficulty:** Start with 4 correct + 2 incorrect bubbles
  4. **Presenter Mode:** Always use presenter mode on a big screen for better engagement
  5. **Round Count:** 3-5 rounds work best for most sessions

  ## Troubleshooting

  - **Players can't join?** Check if they're using the correct player link
  - **Game not progressing?** The host tab must stay open (it controls the game)
  - **Need to restart?** Click "New Game" to reset everything

  Have fun playing Bubble Merge! 🎮
